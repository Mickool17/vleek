While we employ rigorous quality controls and expert handling procedures to protect your items, certain risks inherent to laundering, dry cleaning, and garment care cannot be eliminated. By using ValetKleen’s services, you acknowledge and accept these limitations as outlined below. No Absolute Guarantee Against Damage Despite our best efforts, ValetKleen cannot guarantee against natural occurrences such as color loss, color bleeding, shrinkage, fabric fading, or other alterations that may arise from the cleaning process. These phenomena may result from the garment’s composition, previous treatments, or inherent fabric characteristics. Reporting Damaged Items All claims for damaged items must be submitted in writing to ValetKleen within seven (7) calendar days from the date of delivery. Claims submitted beyond these seven days will be deemed waived and will not be eligible for consideration or compensation. To report damage, customers must contact ValetKleen via email at care@valetkleen.com, providing a detailed description of the damage, order number, delivery details, and photographs of the affected items. Customer Responsibility to Inspect Items Upon receipt of your garments, it is your responsibility to promptly inspect all items and notify ValetKleen of any damages within the specified timeframe. Failure to report damages timely constitutes acceptance of the items as received. Removal of Personal Items and Liability Customers must ensure that all pockets are emptied before submitting their garments. ValetKleen makes a reasonable effort to inspect and remove foreign objects, such as pens, lipstick, coins, headphones, or other personal effects, before cleaning. However, ValetKleen expressly disclaims any liability for damage caused by loose or undisclosed items left inside pockets or bags. Proper Use of ValetKleen Garment Bags ValetKleen provides designated bags for different service types (e.g., Dry Cleaning, Wash & Fold). Customers must use the correct ValetKleen-branded bag corresponding to the intended service. ValetKleen is not liable for damages resulting from misuse of bags, including but not limited to placing dry cleaning garments in wash & fold bags or vice versa. Additional or replacement bags may be obtained upon request via your online account or the ValetKleen mobile app. Evaluation and Determination of Damage All damaged items must be returned to ValetKleen for physical inspection and evaluation. ValetKleen reserves the right to assess whether the damage is attributable to normal wear and tear, pre-existing conditions, improper care, or the cleaning process. Typical wear and tear includes but is not limited to:  Shrinkage due to repeated laundering;  Color fading or bleeding attributable to fabric quality;  Small holes, tears, or thinning fabric;  Discoloration from exposure to elements before service. ValetKleen will make reasonable efforts to restore damaged items to acceptable condition whenever possible. Compensation and Limitation of Liability Suppose an item is determined to be damaged due to ValetKleen’s negligence or error and cannot be restored. In that case, ValetKleen’s liability is limited to reimbursement of up to four (4) times the cleaning fee charged for that specific item, not to exceed a maximum total of five hundred dollars ($500) per claim. Reimbursement will be issued solely as a credit to your ValetKleen account and may be applied to future orders. ValetKleen does not provide cash refunds, checks, or replacement garments as compensation. Disclaimer of Liability ValetKleen is not liable for damages resulting from the following:  Inherent defects or pre-existing conditions in garments;  Customer negligence or failure to disclose relevant garment care information;  Damage caused by foreign objects or misuse of service materials;  Natural shrinkage, color changes, or fabric deterioration occur after service. Acceptance of Terms By submitting your garments to ValetKleen, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Damaged Items Policy and the limits of liability herein. ValetKleen strives to provide the highest level of garment care and customer satisfaction. Your cooperation and understanding of this policy help us serve you better. 26.Lost Item Policy ValetKleen offers professional dry cleaning, wash and fold, and laundry pickup and delivery services with utmost care and diligence. However, by the nature of garment cleaning and handling, there is an inherent risk that items may be lost, misplaced, or otherwise not returned. While ValetKleen has implemented reasonable operational safeguards and procedures designed to minimize the risk of lost items, ValetKleen does not guarantee that such incidents will never occur. Reporting Lost Items Customers must report any suspected lost items within three (3) calendar days following the delivery of their garments. Claims submitted after these three days will be deemed untimely and will not be considered or processed. Exclusions and Limitations of Liability ValetKleen expressly disclaims any liability for the loss of loose personal effects, valuables, or accessories, including, but not limited to, watches, jewelry, earbuds (such as AirPods), cufflinks, or any other items not securely attached to or enclosed within the laundered garments, even if submitted within ValetKleen bags. Furthermore, ValetKleen is not responsible for items lost, misplaced, or damaged before pickup or after delivery has been completed and accepted by the customer. Claim Investigation Process Upon receipt of a timely lost item claim, a designated Customer Care Agent from ValetKleen’s Escalations Team will initiate a formal investigation. This process may include but is not limited to: Comprehensive review of security camera footage; Detailed examination of order tracking logs and delivery records; Interviews with all personnel involved in the handling, processing, and delivery of the affected order; Thorough physical searches within ValetKleen facilities and vehicles. Due to the complexity and detail required, resolution of lost item claims may take up to fifteen (15) business days from the date the claim is filed. Compensation for Lost Items If, after a full investigation, ValetKleen determines that an item is conclusively lost while in our care and cannot be recovered, ValetKleen’s liability will be limited as follows: ValetKleen may provide compensation equal to up to four (4) times the cleaning price paid for the item, with a maximum reimbursement cap of five hundred dollars ($500) per lost item. All compensation will be issued exclusively in the form of account credit to be used toward future ValetKleen services. No cash, check, or direct replacement item purchases will be provided. This limitation of liability represents ValetKleen’s complete and final responsibility regarding lost items and supersedes any other claims or damages that the customer may assert. By using ValetKleen’s services, customers acknowledge and accept these terms and the inherent risks associated with garment cleaning, including the potential for lost items, and agree to abide by the procedures and limitations set forth herein. 27.Pickup and Delivery Terms ValetKleen strives to provide a reliable and convenient laundry and dry cleaning service to all customers. While we endeavor to follow all special instructions regarding pickup and delivery as accurately as possible, certain limitations apply, as outlined below. Customers may authorize ValetKleen to collect or deliver items by leaving them outside their residence with a doorkeeper, concierge, or other designated individual only if written consent has been provided to ValetKleen before service. This consent must authorize such arrangements and release ValetKleen from liability for any risks associated with unattended items or third-party handling. ValetKleen expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for loss, theft, damage, or misplacement of items: Before pickup: including while items are in the customer’s possession, stored on the customer’s premises, or awaiting collection; After delivery: including once items have been left in an authorized location, delivered to a doorkeeper, or handed over to a third party at the delivery address The sole responsibility for safeguarding items before pickup and after delivery rests exclusively with the customer. Customers are advised to ensure all items are securely packaged and identifiable before collection and to verify receipt immediately upon delivery. To facilitate clear communication, ValetKleen will send written notifications confirming the completion of pickup and delivery via SMS, push notification through the mobile application, or email, according to the customer’s selected preferences in their account settings. However, ValetKleen does not guarantee receipt of such notifications and is not responsible for any failures or delays in communication caused by technical or third-party service issues. By using ValetKleen’s services, customers acknowledge and agree to these terms and release ValetKleen from any claims arising from circumstances beyond its control related to the pickup, handling, or delivery of laundry items. 28.Garment Records and Data Retention ValetKleen reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, to maintain records related to the garments you submit for cleaning or related services. Such records may include, but are not limited to, detailed descriptions, images, photographs, or any other form of documentation about your items. ValetKleen may retain, store, display, reproduce, and use these records in association with your name, account information, or other identifying data you provide. These records will be maintained for commercially reasonable periods as determined by ValetKleen, consistent with business needs including, but not limited to, archival purposes, inventory management, quality assurance and control, loss prevention, dispute resolution, and data analysis for service improvement. By using ValetKleen’s services, you expressly consent to ValetKleen’s collection, retention, and use of such records by this policy. ValetKleen is committed to handling all such documents in compliance with applicable privacy laws and industry best practices, protecting your personal information, and ensuring confidentiality. ValetKleen’s retention and use of garment records shall not constitute an ownership interest in your personal property, nor does it affect your ownership rights over your garments. 29.Multiple Account and Referral Program Policy 1. Single Account Restriction ValetKleen permits each user to maintain only one (1) active account. The creation, possession, or use of multiple accounts by the same person, whether directly or indirectly, is strictly prohibited. This policy is established to maintain the integrity of our services, including, but not limited to, our referral and promotional programs. 2. Prohibition of Fraudulent Activity ValetKleen offers referral incentives to reward genuine customer advocacy and grow our community responsibly. Any attempt to manipulate, exploit, or circumvent these programs, including, but not limited to, creating multiple accounts to obtain bonuses or rewards, is considered fraudulent and expressly forbidden. 3. Referral Program Restrictions We reserve the exclusive right to evaluate, approve, or reject any referral, “Refer a Friend” submission, or related bonus eligibility at our sole discretion. Grounds for rejection include, but are not limited to: Referrals involving individuals residing at the same physical address or within the same household; Referrals generated from accounts that are duplicates, non-genuine, or otherwise linked to the referring user; Any indication of artificial inflation or abuse of the referral program rules. 4. Monitoring and Enforcement: ValetKleen employs ongoing monitoring and auditing of referral activity and account behavior to ensure compliance with these policies. Any suspicious or confirmed violations may lead to one or more of the following corrective actions without prior notice: Forfeiture, suspension, or revocation of referral rewards or bonuses; Cancellation of referral credits or bonuses associated with the violating account(s); Temporary suspension or permanent termination of user account(s); Any additional legal remedies are available under applicable law. 5. User Responsibility and Agreement: By participating in ValetKleen’s referral programs or maintaining an account, users agree to comply fully with this policy and acknowledge that any violation may adversely affect their account status and benefits. ValetKleen reserves the right to amend these policies at any time to protect the fairness and integrity of its services. 30.Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and General Legal Provisions This Agreement, including all matters arising out of or relating to your use of the ValetKleen services, shall be governed by and construed by the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to its conflict of law principles. You expressly agree and consent that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, your use of the ValetKleen service, or any of the parties’ obligations hereunder, shall be instituted exclusively in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States. You hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such purposes.

The failure of ValetKleen to insist upon strict enforcement or performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any term, provision, or condition of this Agreement—whether by conduct or otherwise, in any single or multiple instances—shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of any such term, provision, or condition or any other term, provision, or condition. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. This Agreement constitutes the entire, complete, and exclusive Agreement between you and ValetKleen concerning your use of the Service. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and communications, whether oral or written, between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof. Suppose legal action is required to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement. In that case, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, court costs, and other litigation-related expenses incurred in connection therewith, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled under law or equity. Suppose any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable. In that case, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been included. This Agreement does not and is not intended to create or confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as creating any third-party beneficiary rights unless explicitly stated. All rights and obligations hereunder are personal to the parties unless expressly noted otherwise.
